Z8E version 3.6
===============

Z8E is a brilliant debugger for the Z80.  It is about the same
size as ZSID but offers so much more, including interactive
full-screen animated display of instructions and registers.

Originally written by Rick Surwilo in 1984 it underwent a series
of revisions over the next few years.  Apart from contributing
some enhancements of my own, I integrated patches from several
others and attempted to maintain a unified source.  In this I
was largely successful.

This is the first update to Z8E since 1989 and its sole purpose
is to support operation on terminals with more than 24 lines.
For CP/M 2.2 the height of the terminal can be patched but on
CP/M Plus the terminal height is obtained by interrogating the
System Control Block.  No extra bytes were added to the re-
locatable portion of Z8E.

As always, if you make changes to this program then please
update the documentation and post it along with the source
code to somewhere accessible to interested people.  Ongoing
development depends on having source code available.
