; The R512 and W512 callbacks are used to read and write physical sectors.
; They access from DBS_CUR_SECTOR/DBS_CUR_TRACK and read or write DBS_BUFFER.
;
; Note that W128 does not actually write the supplied data --- it requires
; the caller to copy the data to the 128-byte buffer at HL after the call.
; The *next* call to R128 or W128 will flush the data. For deblock mode
; 1, the caller's required to call FLUSH to flush the buffer once this
; is done.
; 
; They have the following signature:
; On entry:
;   IX = pointer to deblocker structure
; On exit:
;   Z on error, NZ on success
